My name is Tanner Gordon and I am a senior at Tufts University studying computer science!!!

These programs power my custom individual addressable LED lights, where the LEDs were wired to an Arduino and connected to my PC. The code is written in C++. 

Inspiration for this project came from moving into my off-campus house and realizing that my room did not have any lights. Rather than buying a lamp, I began this project to apply what I've learned at Tufts to the real world, enhance my ability to self-educate, think outside-the-box, and expand my knowledge of computer science.

I am using 5V WS2812B LEDs!
