  <b>Custom LEDs by Tanner Gordon</b>
  <br>
</h1>

<h3 align="center">I wired individual addressable LEDs to an arduino and coded these programs in C++ to create custom LED light patterns! Click <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAGQU91CC5sS5WuECK37E8sg3OOk2BL_y">here</a> to view videos of these light patterns in action, featuring music that I've produced!
<br>
<br>
<h5 align="center"> Inspiration for this project came from moving into my off-campus house and realizing that my room did not have any lights. Rather than buying a lamp, I began this project to apply what I've learned at Tufts to the real world, thus enhancing my ability to self-educate, think outside-the-box, and expand my knowledge of computer science.
