  <b>Custom LEDs by Tanner Gordon</b>
  <br>
</h1>

<h3 align="center">I wired individual addressable LEDs to an arduino and coded these programs in C++ to create custom LED light patterns! Click <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAGQU91CC5sS5WuECK37E8sg3OOk2BL_y">here</a> to view videos of these light patterns in action, featuring music that I've produced!
<br>
<h5 align="center"> Inspiration for this project came from moving into my off-campus house and realizing that my room did not have any lights. Rather than buying a lamp, I began this project to apply what I've learned at Tufts to the real world, thus enhancing my ability to self-educate, think outside-the-box, and expand my knowledge of computer science.

  I used this program every night before I fell asleep. I would set a time (ex. 30 minutes), and it would take that amount of time for all of the lights to turn off. The program begins with a low-light sunset look, and each led randomly turns off 1 by 1. By the time the timer is up, all of the LEDs have turned off. This program has greatly helped me fall asleep at night, providing a great transition from a waking to a sleeping state!
